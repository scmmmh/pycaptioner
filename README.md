# Spatial Language Expression Generator

The pycaptioner generates natural language expressions that describe a specific location relative to one or more other locations ("On Roald Dahl Plas near the Wales Millennium Centre in Cardiff, UK").

To do this it uses geodata provided by https://github.com/scmmmh/osmgaz.

**Unmaintained**: The gazetteer was developed for a research project, but is no longer maintained or used by me. Please feel free to use it however you wish. If you use it in a research project or publication, please cite:
